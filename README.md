CS-465 Full Stack Development (MEAN)

The different types of development used in the creation of the web application include Express HTML, JavaScript, and Angular frameworks for the single page
application. The front end devolopement for this project included the Express HTML and JavaScript developement, JavaScript was used in both front and back
end developent for this project. The difference between the SPA and the Express HTML is the Express development provided a static HTML web-page for the 
users that had information that could not be changed outside of the main code. The SPA had a fully adjustable webpage that could be changed remotely by
accessing the back end information and being able to update, delete, or add in information. The JavaScript was the main driver that connected these two
and providing the ability to interact between these two different types of development. 

The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB so data could be stored in a more flexible manner and support different data formats like JSON. This allowed the ability 
later for the front end to access and change information within the database. JSON is different from JavaScript because JSON's data format allows
developers to send data from one end to a display seamlessly. This ties the front end and back end by allowing the data to be sent from the database to 
the users screen. 

An area that I struggled with in this project was the UI and I had spent a lot of time to repair the issues that I had ran into. The original issue that I
was having with the project was displaying the picture information from the database to the webpage. This was repaired in a long process of finding the
source of other errors that would prevent the UI from functioning then eventually having to change an HTML file to be able to read the images properly. 
This fix allowed for the data to not only be displayed on the user's web page but also fixed the add, detlete, and edit functionality in the SPA. 

The testing for the SPA was done through MongoDB and Postman, MongoDB was the database used in the project, and Postman worked as a seperate SPA that could
access this database. Using the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions in Postman while connected to the database would allow for testing fuctionalities like
adding or editing information in the database or registering an account, logging into the account, and testing the access code for the account so the admin
could add, delete, or edit their information on the website. Postman was very important in testing because it allowed to find if an issue was on the front
end or the back end in the code. If it worked then the issue was probably in the angular code, if it did not work there may have been an issue in Express. 

This course was one of my favorites so far and might be one of the most important for a professional setting. The use of fullstack development is needed in
almost every company, and the understanding of fullstack and HTML is very important on how developers should work and test for any proffesional setting. I
beleive that this class is a big step into how I can market myself to future employers on how I can develope and launch a single page application while
using adjustable databases, which is really important experience.
